# FlexGroup 
The flexbox Group Displays To start using the Flexbox model, you need to first define a flex container.
## Flex box parent element (container)
Like we specified in the previous , this is a flex container in this project with four flex items with class items.
The flex container becomes flexible by setting the display property to flex.
### The flex container properties are:

-flex-direction
-justify-content
## The flex-direction Property
The flex-direction property defines in which direction the container wants to stack the flex items.
1.The [column] value stacks the flex items vertically (from top to bottom).
2.The [column-reverse] value stacks the flex items vertically (but from bottom to top).
3.The row value stacks the flex items horizontally (from left to right).
4.The row-reverse value stacks the flex items horizontally (but from right to left):

## The justify-content Property
The justify-content property is used to align the flex items:-
1.The center value aligns the flex items at the center of the container.
2.The flex-start value aligns the flex items at the beginning of the container (this is default).
3.The flex-end value aligns the flex items at the end of the container.
4.The space-around value displays the flex items with space before, between, and after the lines.
5.The space-between value displays the flex items with space between the lines.
